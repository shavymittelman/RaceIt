### Overview
This document describes requirements for the software implementation of a newly invented, kid friendly game called Race It. This Software will allow two players to play against each other. A description of the game plus the requirements of this implementation are provided in the spec (spec is in the repo).

### The Game
Two players, get their own path made up of a single line of squares. The players take turns clicking the die which presents a random number from 1 to 6. According to which number they get the player’s path gets color coded with that number of squares. The first player’s path gets color coded in red and the second player’s path turns blue. Some squares will have symbols, if the player hits a symbol, the player will have to advance or move back 1 to 2 squares according to the symbol’s role. The Symbols’ roles will be explained below, by the game’s process and rules. The player that reaches the top first, wins.
